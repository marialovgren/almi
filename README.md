# almi
Designed a [one pager](https://almi-maria-lovgren.netlify.app) using raster graphics editor, vector graphics editor and prototyping tool.

Almi was a schoolproject that I worked on by myself. The task was to create a one-pager and to rebrand an existing website with an imaginary new product. I started with a lo-fi wireframe for mobile and desktop and moved on to a hi-fi wireframe. In the end I created the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScrip. 

### Languages used:
